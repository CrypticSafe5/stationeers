# Heat battery

## Description

This system will provide two functionalities to a base. Those will be a hot line, and a cold line. The gases themselves are not intended to be consumed, but rather to facilitate heat exchange on an as needed basis.

## Infrastructure

There are 2 subsystems that will enable this. The first will be the heat battery itself, which will be where all the waste heat will be transferred from the cold line into the hot line via A/C unit. Attached to the hot line there will be an insulated tank that will hold the majority of the volume. The second subsystem is a "bladder line" that will manage the pressure within the lines in the case of any fluctuation from temperature shifts in either line. It will consist of a pressure regulator and back pressure regulator to both hot and cold lines, and being connected to a tank of an arbitrary temperature.

## Utilization

Within the base, there will be A/C units that will be able to take some arbitrary line of gas and be able to heat or cool it. To heat a gas, you will use the hot line as the waste to the A/C unit, and the target gas as the input and output. To cool a gas, you will perform the same hookups, but instead with the cold line.
